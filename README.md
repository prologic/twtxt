📕 twtxt is a Self-Hosted, Twitter™-like Decentralised micro-Blogging platform. No ads, no tracking, your content, your data!

![](https://twtxt.net/media/XsLsDHuisnXcL6NuUkYguK.png)

> Technically `twtxt` is a multi-user [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) client in the form
> of a web app and api. It supports multiple users and
> also hosts user feeds directly and provides a familiar "social" experience with minimal user profiles.
>
> It also supports "rich" text by utilising Markdown as well as multimedia such as photos, videos and even audio.
>
> There is also a set of [Mobile Apps](https://jointwt.org/goryon/) available for both the App Store and Play Store.

There is also a publicly (_free_) available Pod available at:

- https://twtxt.net/

> __NOTE:__ I, [James Mills](https://github.com/prologic), run this first (_of which I hope to be many_) `twtxt` instance on pretty cheap hardware on a limited budget. Please use it fairly so everyone can enjoy using it equally! Please be sure to read the [/privacy](https://twtxt.net/privacy) policy before signing up (_pretty straight forward_) and happy Twt'ing! 🤗

> **[Sponsor](#Sponsor)** this project to support the development of new features, improving existings ones and fix bugs!
> Or contact [Support](https://twtxt.net) for help with running your own Pod!
> Or host your own Twtxt feed and support our [Extensions](https://dev.twtxt.net).

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

__NOTE:__ Please don't use the pre-built binaries until [Issue #250](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/250) is resolved.
          Please build from source or use the [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/jointwt).
          Thank you. 🙇‍♂️

As a first point, please try to use one of the pre-built binaries that are
available on the [Releases](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/releases) page.

### Using Homebrew

We provide [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) formulae for macOS users for both the
command-line client (`twt`) as well as the server (`twtd`).

```console
brew tap jointwt/twtxt
brew install twtxt
```

Run the server:

```console
twtd
```

Run the command-line client:

```console
twt
```

### Building from source

This is an option if you are familiar with [Go](https://golang.org) development.

1. Clone this repository (_this is important_)

```console
git clone https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt.git
```

2. Install required dependencies (_this is important_)

Linux, macOS:

```console
make deps
```
Note that in order to get the media upload functions to work, you need to
install ffmpeg and its associated `-dev` packages. Consult your distribution's package
repository for availability and names.

FreeBSD:

- Install `gmake`
- Install `pkgconf` that brings `pkg-config`
`gmake deps`

3. Build the binaries

Linux, macOS:

```console
make
```

FreeBSD:

```console
gmake
```


__NOTE___: It is important you follow these steps and don't just simply attempt
           `go get ...` this project as that will not work ([#30](https://github.com/jointwt/twtxt/issues/30)) due to the
           need to package templates and static assets which we use the
           [go.rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) tool for.

## Usage

### Command-line Client

1. Login to  your [Twt.social](https://twt.social) pod:

```#!console
$ ./twt login
INFO[0000] Using config file: /Users/prologic/.twt.yaml
Username:
```

2. Viewing your timeline

```#!console
$ ./twt timeline
INFO[0000] Using config file: /Users/prologic/.twt.yaml

INFO[0015] posting twt...
INFO[0016] post successful
```

### Deploy with Docker Compose

Run the compose configuration:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000/

### Web App

## Configuring your Pod

At a bare minimum you should set the following options:

- `-d /path/to/data`
- `-s bitcask:///path/to/data/twtxt.db` (_we will likely simplify/default this_)
- `-R` to enable open registrations.
- `-O` to enable open profiles.

Most other configuration values _should_ be done via environment variables.

It is _recommended_ you pick an account you want to use to "administer" the
pod with and set the following environment values:

- `ADMIN_USER=username`
- `ADMIN_EMAIL=email`

In order to configure email settings for password recovery and the `/support`
and `/abuse` endpoints, you should set appropriate `SMTP_` values.

It is **highly** recommended you also set the following values to secure your Pod:

- `API_SIGNING_KEY`
- `COOKIE_SECRET`
- `MAGICLINK_SECRET`

These values _should_ be generated with a secure random number generator and
be of length `64` characters long. You can use the following shell snippet
to generate secrets for your pod for the above values:

```console
$ cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 64 | head -n 1
```

**DO NOT** publish or share these values. **BE SURE** to only set them as env vars.

## Production Deployments

### Docker Swarm

You can deploy `twtxt` to a [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
cluster by utilising the provided `twtxt.yaml` Docker Stack. This also depends on
and uses the [Traefik](https://docs.traefik.io/) ingress load balancer so you must
also have that configured and running in your cluster appropriately.

```console
docker stack deploy -c twtxt.yml
```
