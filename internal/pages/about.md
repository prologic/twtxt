# About {{ .InstanceName }}

ðŸ“• {{ .InstanceName}} is a [Twt.social](https://twt.social) Pod; a Self-Hosted,
Twitterâ„¢-like Decentralised micro-Blogging platform. No ads, no tracking,
your content, your data!

> Technically {{ .InstanceName }} is a [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
> client in the form of a web application. You are viewing an instance of
> this software at {{ .InstanceName }}. {{ .InstanceName }} allows you to make
> small posts in a simple easy way without privacy concerns, advertising, tracking
> or the fear of censorship. Think of twtxt as somewhat like Twitterâ„¢ but
> unlike Twitterâ„¢ twtxt and {{ .InstanceName }} are designed to be decentralised.

The [/timeline](/timeline) view displays the latest posts of users on this
instance. Since _twtxt_ itself is a federated and decentralised
micro-blogging format there is no "global" timeline, so you can only discover
posts from users on the same instance as you are on (_{{ .InstanceName }}
in this case_) or by searching for other twtxt feeds such as those
available at [feeds.twtxt.net](https://feeds.twtxt.net).

This software and this instance {{ .InstanceName }} requires user registration
as it both hosts your twtxt feed as well as allows you to fetch, browse, follow
and read other user's feeds or external feeds. The following is a list of features
that are provided:

- Decentralised micro-Blogging, or short-form Posts
- Backed by the simple to read, parse and write [twtxt](https://twtxt.nreadthedocs.org) format specification
- Fully supports [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) rendering including ðŸ˜º pictures!
- Supports [wee-are-twtxt](https://github.com/mdom/we-are-twtxt) feed sources format for discovering external feeds
