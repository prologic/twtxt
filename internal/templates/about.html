    <h1>About twtxt</h1>
    <p>
      twtxt is a <a href="https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">twtxt</a>
      client in the form of a web application. You are viewing an instance of
      this software at {{ .InstanceName }}. twtxt allows you to make small
      posts in a simple easy way without privacy concerns, advertising, tracking
      or the fear of censorship. Think of twtxt as somewhat like Twitterâ„¢ but
      unlike Twitterâ„¢ twtxt and {{ .InstanceName }} are designed to be
      decentralised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="/">timeline</a> view displays the latest posts of
      users on this instance. Since <i>twtxt</i> itself is a federated and
      decentralised micro-blogging format there is no "global" timeline, so
      you can only discover posts from users on the same instance as you are
      on (<i>{{ .InstanceName }} in this case</i>) or by searching for other
      twtxt feeds such as those available at <a href="https://feeds.twtxt.net">feeds.twtxt.net</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
